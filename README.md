The best figure to use is Age to Bp, S1 & S3. This is because there seems to be are significant changes (increase & decrease)
with age to the different columns.

When Age is plotted against comulmns like Bmi, Sex, S5 and S4 gives a linear plot i.e mostly straight line. Also, when Age is
plotted against the Y column the values are all over the graph. There is no variation and no information can be retrieved.

When plotting sex against all columns it only results in giving categories. These categories (1.0 & 2.0) give the same value 
each meanwhile the plot ' Age to Bp, S1 & S3' does not give categories and the values plotted each show a following order.

The last graphh 'S4 to S5, S6 & Y' gives only linear and categrocial values which again atre not conclusive.
