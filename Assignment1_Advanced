  Advance
  
  1 :
  Write a Python program to count the number of characters (character frequency) in a string.
  The expected results are two options: [Example: Babak Khosravifar]
  ○Sorted by alphabetical order [{‘a’:4, ‘b’:2, ‘f’:1, ‘i’:1, .....}]
  ○Sorted by the repetition of characters in descending order [{‘a’:4, ‘b’:2, ‘k’:2, ‘r’:2,.....}]2
 
 
print('Type in a word')
word = input()
wordlist = list(word) # Convert string to list.
wordlist.sort()

frequency = {}

for i in wordlist: 
    if i in frequency: 
        frequency[i] += 1 ## Add up to the letter count
    else: 
        frequency[i] = 1

print(frequency)

 
2 :
Write a Python program to count the occurrences of each word in a given sentence.


print('Type in a word')
sentence = input()
sentence = str.split(sentence) #Split the sentence into words

counts = {}

for i in sentence:
    if i in counts:
        counts[i] += 1
    else:
        counts[i] = 1
            
print(counts)


3 : ****
Write a Python program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input 
and prints the unique words in sorted form (alphanumerically).
