BASIC
Question 2 :
Write a function that takes an ordered list of numbers (a list where the elements are in
order from smallest to largest) and another number. The function decides whether or not
the given number is inside the list and returns (then prints) an appropriate boolean.


def inList(list_1, number):
    if number in list_1:
        return('True') # Show true if the number is in the list.
    else:
        return('False') # Show false if the number is in the list.
       
# Calling the function:
print(singleList([1,2,3,5,9,14,20], 10))
