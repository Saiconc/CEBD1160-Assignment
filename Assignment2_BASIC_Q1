BASIC

Question 1 :
Write a program (function!) that takes a list and returns a new list that contains all the
elements of the first list minus all the duplicates.


def SingleList(x):
    y = []
    for i in x:  # For every element in list x,
        if i not in y:  # if that element is not in list y,
            y.append(i)  # then add it to list y.
   
    return y

#Calling the function:
print(singleList([1,2,2,2,3,5,5,5,7,9,10]))
