Question 3 :
Let’s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100].
Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even
elements of this list in it.

a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
# If a number in list “a” is divisible by 2 with no remainders i.e even,
# add n to the new list “b”.
b = [n for n in a if n%2 == 0] 
    
print(b)
